Robot Battledome is a simple game built with JavaScript that lets a user fight robots to the death. A user chooses two robots and outfits each robot with a weapon and modification. Once the user's selections are made, a battle begins, in which each robot causes random damage to its opponent based on its assets. 

I designed this game to complete an assignment at Nashville Software School that incorporated prototypal inheritance, DOM manipulation with jQuery, ES6 syntax, task automation with Gulp, and basic testing with Jasmine.
